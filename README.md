## Motivation

The motivation for creating this travel app is to help inspire the user's future travel dreams and help streamline all of the components that go into organizing a successful trip. From researching and reserving flights, to booking hotels and rental cars, to reserving once in a lifetime activities and dining experiences, this travel app will aid in organizing and booking as many details of a travel plan as the user desires. The user can request small suggestions for their mostly planned trip, or use the tool to fully plan an itinerary, export fine details into a Google Calendar fully equipped with map markers, travel times, and daily and/or overal budgets in view.

## Usage

(Will organize later)
Text box with autofill where user would like to travel - added feature to add destinations

When user fills out the text box, app will show autofill options for popular destinations
When user chooses a destination, option s to plan based off of budget, how many days, and if user wants to add more stops populates
When user loads the main page, location will be asked so application can use stored knowledge to make more accurate travel plans and populate more up-to-date prices
When user views UI, a visible and easily accessible button to access a trip wizard will be available. Will lead to questionnaire module that will help curate travel suggestions for user.
User can use application just to find flights, housing, or other activity search and planning functions individually if desired.
